          <h2>Key features</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Privacy:</strong>
              If you go for a sharing cab, undoubtedly your privacy gets
              compromised which is why people prefer to book private cabs.
              Private cabs protect you from unavoidable interference from
              co-passengers on a sharing cab.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Complete Control</strong>
              when you book a sharing cab you cannot have complete control of
              your trip, of course, you will have to adjust according to the
              fellow passenger. This kind of experience might not always be
              good, sometimes it can lead to unnecessary delays which not
              everyone can afford. A private cab allows you to plan everything
              according to your time and need.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Security and Trust</strong>
              Though every good cab agency nowadays conducts a proper
              investigation of their drivers, still no such questioning is ever
              done for the passengers, which is why there is often a fear while
              booking a sharing cab. When you go for a private cab, your
              security is completely ensured.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Affordability</strong>
              : Booking a one way taxi to any city is quite affordable. The
              client is informed about the complete cost before booking so there
              will be no issue remain after completion of tour.
